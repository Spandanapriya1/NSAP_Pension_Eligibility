**NSAP Pension Eligibility Prediction** 

This project is my personal effort to create a machine learning model that predicts pension eligibility under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP).  

**Project Overview**

I developed a system that uses district-level demographic, socio-economic, and Aadhaar/mobile coverage data to predict which beneficiaries are eligible for pension benefits.  

**Features** 

I collected and cleaned data from several relevant sources.  
I built and trained a Random Forest Classifier to determine pension eligibility.  
I deployed the model on the IBM Watson Machine Learning platform to provide scalable, real-time predictions through an API.  

**Installation** 

To run this project, you will need the following:  

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- ibm-watson-machine-learning SDK  

**Usage**

I provide scripts for data preprocessing and for training the model.  
The model is deployed on IBM Watson ML for real-time use.  
Users can access predictions through the deployed API.  

**Results**

The model I developed achieved high accuracy and reliable confidence scores in predicting pension eligibility.  

**Future Work** 

I plan to include real-time data feeds for better prediction accuracy.  
I aim to create user-friendly dashboards to visualize results for stakeholders.  
I will also explore machine learning techniques like deep learning to improve the model.
